#### ðŸŒ± Details about me: 

- I am currently a masterâ€™s student at Beijing University of Technology of China.
- I am currently interested in AI Infra, including **Model Compression**, **Model** **Quantization**, **Inference**, etc.
- I used to be an intern at Baidu and OPPO, and both the internship content was about model Quantization.
